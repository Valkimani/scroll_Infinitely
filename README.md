# scroll_Infinitely

The scroll infinitely mimics behavior that appears on social media platforms as users scroll to the bottom of the page. A network request is made; however, this happens before the user reaches the bottom that way it feels like they're scrolling forever. 

The images are photos fetched from the unsplashed API.
